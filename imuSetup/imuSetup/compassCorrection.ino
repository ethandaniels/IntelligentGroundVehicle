/* This function will create a compass reading based on: magnemoeter and gyro
values. As magnemoeter is only truly accurate when taking level readings.
Along with this magnetic deliniation will be manually updated in the code based
on general city location.

This is not optimal though deliniation would only change by ~.2ยบ around the course

Set your calculators to raidans boys

Anytime you see *variable, this is a pointer. Must be used to pull values from other functions, it allows
to pull variables from physical memory.
