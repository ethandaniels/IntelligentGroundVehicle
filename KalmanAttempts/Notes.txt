GPIO:
Previously the GPIO was not cleaned. The flags were suppressed, which works
though could cause GPIO issues/exit failures. GPIO is hystertic so when .py
starts again old information will cause issues in processing
~solution: attempt error catching with try statments and clean at exit

IMU:
The IMU currently only reading in the compass heading from serial. It would
be benifical to get the other 6 DOFs that this sensor offers.

Kalman:
Unsure at this point how to use kalman filter to combine GPS and IMU

True North:
Possibly be an issue with the way the compass value was being read in

LIDAR:
The LIDAR needs to be tested and implemented. Currently we have example code,
will have to test if it works


Current thought process 7/26:
Upgrade to Arduino Zero for 32 bit ARM cortex (gives 48Mhz speed)
GPS and IMU controlled by this
Serial output of Lat,Lon,Magnetometer(x,y,z),Absolute Orientation(w,x,y,z)
and Acceleration Vector (grav+x,y,z)

Send this single serial input at 5-10Hz refresh rate to pi
-On pi process fuzzy logic kalman filtering for best estimated lat, lon
-On pi use filter new lat, lon and Magnetometer values for best known heading


Solution overview:

-High Priority
GPS+IMU passthrough Kalman for best position results
Must correct issue with finding true north
Test LIDAR, implement in design
Navigation Algorithm

-Desirables
Upgrade camera. Will want to have a camera straight ahead and above for lines
This will include a great amount of OpenCV work. SPRING Semester
