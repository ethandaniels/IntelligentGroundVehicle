iOS and Bluetooth LE Arudino: https://learn.adafruit.com/bno055-ble-ios-app
Compass heading using magnetometers: http://bit.ly/2uVgGRp
Calculating north with two GPS: http://bit.ly/2vxV7TX
NGA C code for declination: http://bit.ly/2unmGAN


Notes about using I2C:
- On SDA and SCL boards typically use 10k pull ups, sometimes this isn't enough..
if this is the case add: 3.3k to SCL and 2.2K to SDA. (kOhms)

Notes on GPS:
- Will desire true North
- Use of multiple antennas
- Will have to use a Kalman filter combining 9 DOF readings and GPS data for
improved performance

Notes on Camera: Desire a camera with best resolution and refresh rate
This camera update would come into play if we had the money.


!!Would like to consolidate use of arudinos!!
